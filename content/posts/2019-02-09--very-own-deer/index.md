When I was about 8 years old, I recalled a conversation that I had had with my neighbors about how their father would put bricks of salt and piles of apples just beyond the tree line behind their house. At the time I had no idea that salt and apples would attract deer.

I felt bad for the deer, being lured in with tasty apples and a salty treat would just make them sitting ducks when the neighbors stepfather wanted more venison.
