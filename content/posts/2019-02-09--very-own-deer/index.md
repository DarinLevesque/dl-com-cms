When I was about 8 years old, I had a conversation with my neighbors about why their father would put bricks of salt and piles of apples just beyond the tree line behind their house. They explained to me that the salt and apples attracts deer, and their step-father was a hunter who really enjoyed venison. I had no clue. I didn’t understand why someone would trick a deer with food and then kill it, just like that. It seemed like cheating to me, like giving your dog a bone, and then **BOOM**…dirt nap. I felt bad for the deer, being lured in with tasty apples and a salty treat would just make them sitting ducks.

#### So I was going to do something about it

> I was going to catch a deer.

Remember, I was 8 years old. But I was the kind of 8-year-old who knew how to play hockey, swim like a fish, and even catch fish with my trusty push button fishing rod. ![](E:\Development\dl-com-cms\content\posts\2019-02-09--very-own-deer\kid-fish.png)

So one fall day after school, I was determined to thwart my neighbors plan to kill a deer, by making one my pet. I went down to the basement, where my father’s workbench was as organized as a town just hit by a tornado. I found some fishing line, the largest fish hook I could find, and came up with an ingenious plan.

“Mom, can I have an apple please?”

My mother looked at me like I was speaking a foreign tongue yet she knew exactly what I was talking about. I went back down stairs and grabbed my line and hook, and then went out the basement door which led behind our house. I scouted a tree that had cover but could also be slightly seen from the house, so that my new deer friend could rest in the shade until I came home from school to start our long term friendship.

### Day One

The first day was the worst. I could hardly wait to get home from school and didn’t pay a lick of attention to any of my third grade classes. I raced off the school bus hoping that my Mom wouldn’t notice that I ran behind the house to check for my deer. To my disappointment, there was no deer. I inspected the apple and made sure that the hook was sunk in just right and the apple  was positioned so that the most enticing first bite would give me the best chance of actually catching a deer.

### Day Two

When I got off the bus I still raced out back, but this time I stopped closer to the house, because I didn’t see a deer, and I was confident that I set it up right the day prior.

### Day Three

I heard about a cartoon on the bus that I couldn’t wait to go try to watch. To be honest, I forgot about my deer trap.

### Day 8

Because I was 8, and I had so many creative things to accomplish, I completely lost interest in my deer trap at this point. I was up in my room after I got home from school when I heard a very deep, and very concerning, “DAAAAAARRRRRRIIIIN!” from downstairs.

## Fifteen minutes earlier

My father came home from work just past four, as usual. He came in the house, let the dog out, said hello to my Mom, grabbed a drink, and then went to let my dog back inside. Mason, our 6 year old springer spaniel, was really well trained to stay right around the house and wasn’t interested in leaving the yard. My dad opened the door and hollered, “MAAASON,” as he usually did to get him back inside. Except this time Mason didn’t come. My dad shouted a few more times, but the usually punctual dog was nowhere to be seen. My father walked around the back of the house and was about to shout again, but realized that Mason was in the woods, looking like he was struggling with something.

##### He found Mason with a fish hook through his lip tied to a tree.

### The verdict

My father bellowed for me. I came running down the stairs excited to see what was going on, only to be severely confused at what I saw. My dad was holding my dog, with about 8 feet of fishing line in tow. It all dawned on me in a moment, and I’m almost certain that my parents both saw the blood run from my face as it turned ghostly white. 

I ended up, after lots of tears and apologies, fessing up about how I was trying to catch a deer, and not our domesticated dog. My father tried to remove the hook himself with pliers, but nearly wound up with a fish hook through his thumb. So he took Mason to the vet and let them deal with my mistake.

In the end, I didn’t get in trouble because of a conversation that my mom had with one of her professors in a course she was taking. My mom told the professor what I did and the professor pleaded that she hoped that I wasn’t in trouble because it was such a novel idea for an 8 year old.
