#### Background
When I was young, I felt very fortunate. Growing up in a rural New England seacoast town gave me many opportunities which I'm realizing as an adult, many other parts of the country didn't have available. A hockey rink and indoor swimming pools were less than 5 miles from my childhood home. We had woods which enabled a young boy's imagination to run wild. One day I could running from bandits, the next I could be tarzan climbing trees, or even attempting to catch a pet deer. I literally felt like the sky was the limit.

Now, I'm in my mid-thirties, and I haven't spoken to my parents in over a year. I ask myself nearly daily, "How did we get here?"
