#### Background
When I was young, I felt very fortunate. Growing up in a rural New England seacoast town gave me many opportunities which I'm realizing as an adult, many other parts of the country didn't have available. A hockey rink and indoor swimming pools were less than 5 miles from my childhood home. We had woods which enabled a young boy's imagination to run wild. One day I could running from bandits, the next I could be tarzan climbing trees, or even attempting to catch a pet deer. I literally felt like the sky was the limit.

Now, I'm in my mid-thirties, haven't spoken to my parents in over a year and ask myself nearly daily, "How did we get here?"

How did my relationship with my parents become so broken? 

It started near the beginning of my relationship with Kelli. I was separated from my ex, going through a ridiculous divorce and was getting pulled in many different directions in order to please the most amount of people. Despit
